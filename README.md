# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 3

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

#### What is this homework assignment about?
The assignment is about implementing an interface, implementing a collection class etc.
### Gather

#### What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new?
I need to gain knowledge about collection ADT and the use of iterators to implement them in the homework
### Brainstorm

#### What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment?
following the 'What you need to' do might be a good start, writing well formed would give me an idea of how the data structure/iterator is working 

### Plan

#### What will I work on first after I finish this planning part?
I would work with learning and getting myself familiar with collection ADT. 
Then implement wellformed, then robot class's methods, and then finally with collection ADT. 

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

#### Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties?
Yes, I was able to anticipate the most of the difficulties correctly, in the beginning I was confused if I had to use iterator to implement Robot methods but then I saw a piazza post clarifying the same.

#### How did the plan go?
The plan went fine, but this homework also has efficiency testing so I should have took care of that earlier now that I have already developed an algorithms I am finding it difficult to optimize it.

### Preview

#### What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment?
I should keep in mind efficiency in mind while coding from next time. 

#### Do I need more resources?
Oracle's online resources have helped me along with piazza, most my questions were already answered by previous queries on piazza.
